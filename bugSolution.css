The solution lies in using parentheses to control the order of operations within the `calc()` function:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 20px);
}
```

The correct way to achieve the intended result is:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 20px);
}
```

By adding parentheses, we explicitly dictate that 50% of the parent width should be calculated before subtracting 20 pixels. This ensures that the width is computed accurately.
